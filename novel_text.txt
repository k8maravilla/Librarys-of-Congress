('The Cyclone', 54)
('Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle', 55)
('Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer’s wife. Their', 56)
('house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon', 57)
('many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one', 58)
('room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for', 59)
('the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry', 60)
('and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in', 61)

('small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family', 63)
('could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to', 64)

('middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark', 66)
('hole.', 67)
('When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see', 68)
('nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a', 69)
('house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of', 70)
('the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a', 71)
('gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was', 72)
('not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until', 73)
('they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had', 74)
('been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it', 75)
('away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.', 76)
('When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun', 77)
('and wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes', 78)
('and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and', 79)
('lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled', 80)
('now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had', 81)
('been so startled by the child’s laughter that she would scream and', 82)
('press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy’s merry voice reached', 83)
('her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she', 84)
('could find anything to laugh at.', 85)
('Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and', 86)
('did not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his', 87)
('rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.', 88)
('It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray', 89)
('as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black', 90)
('dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on', 91)
('either side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and', 92)
('Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.', 93)
('Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the', 94)
('doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than', 95)
('usual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at', 96)
('the sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes.', 97)
('From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry', 98)
('and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the', 99)
('coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the', 100)

('Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.', 103)
('“There’s a cyclone coming, Em,” he called to his wife. “I’ll go look', 104)

('in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole.', 112)
('Dorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt. When she', 113)
('was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind,', 114)
('and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down', 115)
('suddenly upon the floor.', 116)
('Then a strange thing happened.', 117)
('The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the', 118)
('air. Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.', 119)
('The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the', 120)
('exact center of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air is', 121)
('generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of', 122)
('the house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top', 123)
('of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles', 124)
('away as easily as you could carry a feather.', 125)
('It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy', 126)
('found she was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls around,', 127)
('and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were', 128)
('being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.', 129)
('Toto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there,', 130)
('barking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to', 131)
('see what would happen.', 132)
('Once Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first', 133)
('the little girl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his', 134)
('ears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air', 135)
('was keeping him up so that he could not fall. She crept to the hole,', 136)
('caught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again, afterward', 137)
('closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen.', 138)
('Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright;', 139)
('but she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about', 140)
('her that she nearly became deaf. At first she had wondered if she would', 141)
('be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed', 142)
('and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to', 143)
('wait calmly and see what the future would bring. At last she crawled', 144)
('over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and Toto', 145)
('followed and lay down beside her.', 146)
('In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind,', 147)
('Dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep.', 148)
('Chapter II', 149)
('The Council with the Munchkins', 150)
('She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had', 151)
('not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt. As it was, the', 152)
('jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto', 153)
('put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally. Dorothy sat', 154)
('up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the', 155)
('bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room. She', 156)
('sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.', 157)
('The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes', 158)
('growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.', 159)
('The cyclone had set the house down very gently—for a cyclone—in the', 160)
('midst of a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches of', 161)
('greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious', 162)
('fruits. Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with', 163)
('rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes.', 164)

('who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.', 167)
('While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights,', 168)
('she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had', 169)
('ever seen. They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been', 170)
('used to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about', 171)
('as tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although', 172)

('Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little', 193)

('before. But tell me, is it a civilized country?”', 242)
('“Oh, yes,” replied Dorothy.', 243)
('“Then that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe there', 244)
('are no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians. But,', 245)
('you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off', 246)

('“What is it?” asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to', 256)
('laugh. The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing', 257)

('“She was so old,” explained the Witch of the North, “that she dried up', 259)

('“I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will', 269)
('worry about me. Can you help me find my way?”', 270)
('The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at', 271)
('Dorothy, and then shook their heads.', 272)
('“At the East, not far from here,” said one, “there is a great desert,', 273)
('and none could live to cross it.”', 274)

('also. As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced', 286)
('the point on the end of her nose, while she counted “One, two, three”', 287)
('in a solemn voice. At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was', 288)

('The three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey,', 316)

('She gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it', 328)
('down to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water.', 329)

('there. Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging', 331)

('she wanted to help out her breakfast.', 333)
('Then she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to', 334)
('a good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for', 335)
('the journey to the City of Emeralds.', 336)
('Dorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was', 337)
('hanging on a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white', 338)
('and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings,', 339)
('it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed', 340)
('herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head.', 341)
('She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard,', 342)
('laying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and', 343)
('noticed how old and worn her shoes were.', 344)
('“They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,” she said. And', 345)
('Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his', 346)
('tail to show he knew what she meant.', 347)
('At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had', 348)
('belonged to the Witch of the East.', 349)
('“I wonder if they will fit me,” she said to Toto. “They would be just', 350)
('the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.”', 351)
('She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which', 352)
('fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.', 353)
('Finally she picked up her basket.', 354)
('“Come along, Toto,” she said. “We will go to the Emerald City and ask', 355)

('She closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket', 357)
('of her dress. And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she', 358)
('started on her journey.', 359)
('There were several roads nearby, but it did not take her long to find', 360)
('the one paved with yellow bricks. Within a short time she was walking', 361)
('briskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on', 362)
('the hard, yellow road-bed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang', 363)
('sweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a', 364)
('little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own', 365)
('country and set down in the midst of a strange land.', 366)
('She was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country', 367)
('was about her. There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted', 368)
('a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and', 369)
('vegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and', 370)
('able to raise large crops. Once in a while she would pass a house, and', 371)
('the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for', 372)
('everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and', 373)
('setting them free from bondage. The houses of the Munchkins were', 374)
('odd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof.', 375)
('All were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the', 376)
('favorite color.', 377)
('Toward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to', 378)
('wonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather', 379)
('larger than the rest. On the green lawn before it many men and women', 380)
('were dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and', 381)
('the people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was', 382)
('loaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other', 383)
('good things to eat.', 384)
('The people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to', 385)
('pass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest', 386)

('people dance.', 391)

('“Why?” asked the girl.', 393)
('“Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch.', 394)

('wear white.”', 396)
('“My dress is blue and white checked,” said Dorothy, smoothing out the', 397)
('wrinkles in it.', 398)
('“It is kind of you to wear that,” said Boq. “Blue is the color of the', 399)
('Munchkins, and white is the witch color. So we know you are a friendly', 400)

('think her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary', 403)
('little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange', 404)
('land.', 405)
('When she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house,', 406)
('where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were made', 407)
('of blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with', 408)
('Toto curled up on the blue rug beside her.', 409)
('She ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played', 410)
('with Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that', 411)
('greatly amused Dorothy. Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people,', 412)
('for they had never seen a dog before.', 413)
('“How far is it to the Emerald City?” the girl asked.', 414)
('“I do not know,” answered Boq gravely, “for I have never been there. It', 415)
('is better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business', 416)
('with him. But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take', 417)

('could help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn', 422)
('back.', 423)
('She bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of', 424)
('yellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would', 425)
('stop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road', 426)
('and sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far', 427)
('away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from', 428)
('the ripe corn.', 429)
('Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the', 430)
('Scarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes,', 431)
('nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue', 432)
('hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and', 433)
('the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded,', 434)

('with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure', 436)
('was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its', 437)

('head to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and', 443)
('walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.', 444)
('“Good day,” said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.', 445)
('“Did you speak?” asked the girl, in wonder.', 446)
('“Certainly,” answered the Scarecrow. “How do you do?”', 447)
('“I’m pretty well, thank you,” replied Dorothy politely. “How do you', 448)
('do?”', 449)
('“I’m not feeling well,” said the Scarecrow, with a smile, “for it is', 450)
('very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.”', 451)
('“Can’t you get down?” asked Dorothy.', 452)
('“No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away', 453)

('speak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.', 460)

('yawned. “And where are you going?”', 462)
('“My name is Dorothy,” said the girl, “and I am going to the Emerald', 463)

('“Why, don’t you know?” she returned, in surprise.', 466)
('“No, indeed. I don’t know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no', 467)

('time is all unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one', 541)
('of the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what', 542)
('was going on. There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing', 543)
('I heard was the farmer saying, ‘How do you like those ears?’', 544)
('“‘They aren’t straight,’” answered the other.', 545)
('“‘Never mind,’” said the farmer. “‘They are ears just the same,’” which', 546)
('was true enough.', 547)
('“‘Now I’ll make the eyes,’” said the farmer. So he painted my right', 548)
('eye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and', 549)
('at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my', 550)

('“‘I think I’ll make the other a little bigger,’” said the farmer. And', 554)
('when the second eye was done I could see much better than before. Then', 555)
('he made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at that time', 556)
('I didn’t know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching them make', 557)
('my body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at', 558)

('anyone.', 560)
('“‘This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,’ said the farmer. ‘He', 561)
('looks just like a man.’', 562)
('“‘Why, he is a man,’ said the other, and I quite agreed with him. The', 563)
('farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a', 564)

('away and left me alone.', 566)
('“I did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them.', 567)

('having been made such a little while before. Many crows and other birds', 570)
('flew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away', 571)
('again, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me feel', 572)

('said:', 575)
('“‘I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner. Any', 576)

('hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. The other birds,', 578)
('seeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short', 579)
('time there was a great flock of them about me.', 580)
('“I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow', 581)

('Scarecrow.', 595)
('There were no fences at all by the roadside now, and the land was rough', 596)
('and untilled. Toward evening they came to a great forest, where the', 597)
('trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the', 598)
('road of yellow brick. It was almost dark under the trees, for the', 599)
('branches shut out the daylight; but the travelers did not stop, and', 600)
('went on into the forest.', 601)
('“If this road goes in, it must come out,” said the Scarecrow, “and as', 602)
('the Emerald City is at the other end of the road, we must go wherever', 603)
('it leads us.”', 604)
('“Anyone would know that,” said Dorothy.', 605)
('“Certainly; that is why I know it,” returned the Scarecrow. “If it', 606)
('required brains to figure it out, I never should have said it.”', 607)
('After an hour or so the light faded away, and they found themselves', 608)
('stumbling along in the darkness. Dorothy could not see at all, but Toto', 609)
('could, for some dogs see very well in the dark; and the Scarecrow', 610)
('declared he could see as well as by day. So she took hold of his arm', 611)
('and managed to get along fairly well.', 612)
('“If you see any house, or any place where we can pass the night,” she', 613)
('said, “you must tell me; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the', 614)

('“Yes, indeed,” answered the child. “I am all tired out.”', 619)
('So the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the', 620)
('cottage, and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one', 621)

('sound sleep. The Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in another', 623)

('Chapter V', 625)
('The Rescue of the Tin Woodman', 626)
('When Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto had', 627)
('long been out chasing birds around him and squirrels. She sat up and', 628)
('looked around her. There was the Scarecrow, still standing patiently in', 629)
('his corner, waiting for her.', 630)
('“We must go and search for water,” she said to him.', 631)
('“Why do you want water?” he asked.', 632)
('“To wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so the', 633)
('dry bread will not stick in my throat.”', 634)
('“It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh,” said the Scarecrow', 635)
('thoughtfully, “for you must sleep, and eat and drink. However, you have', 636)
('brains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly.”', 637)
('They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a', 638)
('little spring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate', 639)
('her breakfast. She saw there was not much bread left in the basket, and', 640)
('the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything, for', 641)
('there was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day.', 642)
('When she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of', 643)
('yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.', 644)
('“What was that?” she asked timidly.', 645)
('“I cannot imagine,” replied the Scarecrow; “but we can go and see.”', 646)
('Just then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to', 647)
('come from behind them. They turned and walked through the forest a few', 648)
('steps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine', 649)
('that fell between the trees. She ran to the place and then stopped', 650)
('short, with a little cry of surprise.', 651)
('One of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing', 652)
('beside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely', 653)
('of tin. His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he', 654)
('stood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.', 655)
('Dorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while', 656)
('Toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his', 657)
('teeth.', 658)
('“Did you groan?” asked Dorothy.', 659)
('“Yes,” answered the tin man, “I did. I’ve been groaning for more than a', 660)
('year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me.”', 661)
('“What can I do for you?” she inquired softly, for she was moved by the', 662)
('sad voice in which the man spoke.', 663)
('“Get an oil-can and oil my joints,” he answered. “They are rusted so', 664)
('badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon', 665)
('be all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage.”', 666)
('Dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then', 667)
('she returned and asked anxiously, “Where are your joints?”', 668)
('“Oil my neck, first,” replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, and as', 669)
('it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and', 670)
('moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the', 671)
('man could turn it himself.', 672)
('“Now oil the joints in my arms,” he said. And Dorothy oiled them and', 673)
('the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust', 674)
('and as good as new.', 675)
('The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which', 676)
('he leaned against the tree.', 677)

('last. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right', 680)
('once more.”', 681)
('So they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked', 682)
('them again and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite', 683)
('creature, and very grateful.', 684)
('“I might have stood there always if you had not come along,” he said;', 685)

('answered, “and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night.”', 688)
('“Why do you wish to see Oz?” he asked.', 689)
('“I want him to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him to', 690)
('put a few brains into his head,” she replied.', 691)
('The Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment. Then he said:', 692)
('“Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?”', 693)
('“Why, I guess so,” Dorothy answered. “It would be as easy as to give', 694)
('the Scarecrow brains.”', 695)
('“True,” the Tin Woodman returned. “So, if you will allow me to join', 696)
('your party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me.”', 697)
('“Come along,” said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she', 698)
('would be pleased to have his company. So the Tin Woodman shouldered his', 699)
('axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road', 700)
('that was paved with yellow brick.', 701)
('The Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket.', 702)
('“For,” he said, “if I should get caught in the rain, and rust again, I', 703)
('would need the oil-can badly.”', 704)
('It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party, for', 705)
('soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place', 706)
('where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the', 707)
('travelers could not pass. But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe', 708)
('and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire', 709)
('party.', 710)
('Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not', 711)
('notice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the', 712)
('side of the road. Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up', 713)
('again.', 714)
('“Why didn’t you walk around the hole?” asked the Tin Woodman.', 715)
('“I don’t know enough,” replied the Scarecrow cheerfully. “My head is', 716)
('stuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask', 717)
('him for some brains.”', 718)
('“Oh, I see,” said the Tin Woodman. “But, after all, brains are not the', 719)
('best things in the world.”', 720)
('“Have you any?” inquired the Scarecrow.', 721)
('“No, my head is quite empty,” answered the Woodman. “But once I had', 722)
('brains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much', 723)
('rather have a heart.”', 724)
('“And why is that?” asked the Scarecrow.', 725)
('“I will tell you my story, and then you will know.”', 726)
('So, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told', 727)
('the following story:', 728)
('“I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest', 729)
('and sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a', 730)
('woodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as', 731)
('long as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone', 732)
('I would marry, so that I might not become lonely.', 733)
('“There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon', 734)
('grew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry', 735)
('me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for', 736)
('her; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old', 737)
('woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she', 738)
('wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the', 739)
('housework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and', 740)
('promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.', 741)
('Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping', 742)
('away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my', 743)
('wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my', 744)
('left leg.', 745)
('“This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man', 746)
('could not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and', 747)
('had him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I', 748)
('was used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for', 749)
('she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin', 750)
('girl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right', 751)
('leg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of', 752)
('tin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other;', 753)
('but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked', 754)
('Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I', 755)
('thought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come', 756)
('along, and he made me a new head out of tin.', 757)
('“I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than', 758)
('ever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a', 759)
('new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my', 760)
('axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into', 761)
('two halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body', 762)
('of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of', 763)
('joints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had', 764)
('now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did', 765)
('not care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living', 766)
('with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.', 767)
('“My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and', 768)
('it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There', 769)
('was only one danger—that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in', 770)
('my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However,', 771)
('there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a', 772)
('rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I', 773)
('was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a', 774)
('terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time', 775)
('to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart.', 776)
('While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can', 777)

('one. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.”', 779)
('Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story', 780)
('of the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a', 781)
('new heart.', 782)
('“All the same,” said the Scarecrow, “I shall ask for brains instead of', 783)
('a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had', 784)
('one.”', 785)
('“I shall take the heart,” returned the Tin Woodman; “for brains do not', 786)
('make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.”', 787)
('Dorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her', 788)
('two friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to', 789)
('Kansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had', 790)
('no brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.', 791)
('What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another', 792)

('“You will be very welcome,” answered Dorothy, “for you will help to', 895)
('keep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be more', 896)
('cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily.”', 897)
('“They really are,” said the Lion, “but that doesn’t make me any braver,', 898)
('and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy.”', 899)
('So once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion', 900)
('walking with stately strides at Dorothy’s side. Toto did not approve of', 901)
('this new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had', 902)
('been crushed between the Lion’s great jaws. But after a time he became', 903)
('more at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be', 904)
('good friends.', 905)
('During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the', 906)
('peace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a', 907)
('beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little', 908)
('thing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always', 909)
('careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept', 910)
('several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his', 911)
('face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When', 912)
('Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open', 913)
('his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly', 914)
('frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but', 915)
('she could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was', 916)
('wrong. But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy’s basket and', 917)
('oiled the Woodman’s jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as', 918)
('well as before.', 919)
('“This will serve me a lesson,” said he, “to look where I step. For if I', 920)
('should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying', 921)
('rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak.”', 922)
('Thereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and', 923)
('when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to', 924)
('harm it. The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore', 925)
('he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.', 926)
('“You people with hearts,” he said, “have something to guide you, and', 927)
('need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very', 928)
('careful. When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn’t mind so much.”', 929)
('Chapter VII', 930)
('The Journey to the Great Oz', 931)
('They were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the', 932)
('forest, for there were no houses near. The tree made a good, thick', 933)
('covering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a', 934)
('great pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that', 935)
('warmed her and made her feel less lonely. She and Toto ate the last of', 936)
('their bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.', 937)
('“If you wish,” said the Lion, “I will go into the forest and kill a', 938)
('deer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so', 939)
('peculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very', 940)
('good breakfast.”', 941)
('“Don’t! Please don’t,” begged the Tin Woodman. “I should certainly weep', 942)
('if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.”', 943)
('But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no', 944)
('one ever knew what it was, for he didn’t mention it. And the Scarecrow', 945)
('found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy’s basket with them, so', 946)
('that she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very', 947)
('kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the', 948)
('awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded', 949)
('hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost', 950)
('as many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how', 951)
('long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away', 952)
('from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn', 953)
('him up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came', 954)
('near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. These', 955)
('kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.', 956)
('When it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling', 957)
('brook, and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City.', 958)
('This was to be an eventful day for the travelers. They had hardly been', 959)
('walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed', 960)
('the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either', 961)
('side. It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and', 962)
('looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were', 963)
('many big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The sides were so steep that none', 964)
('of them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their journey', 965)
('must end.', 966)
('“What shall we do?” asked Dorothy despairingly.', 967)
('“I haven’t the faintest idea,” said the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook', 968)
('his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.', 969)
('But the Scarecrow said, “We cannot fly, that is certain. Neither can we', 970)
('climb down into this great ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump over it,', 971)
('we must stop where we are.”', 972)
('“I think I could jump over it,” said the Cowardly Lion, after measuring', 973)
('the distance carefully in his mind.', 974)
('“Then we are all right,” answered the Scarecrow, “for you can carry us', 975)
('all over on your back, one at a time.”', 976)
('“Well, I’ll try it,” said the Lion. “Who will go first?”', 977)
('“I will,” declared the Scarecrow, “for, if you found that you could not', 978)
('jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly', 979)
('dented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not matter', 980)
('so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all.”', 981)
('“I am terribly afraid of falling, myself,” said the Cowardly Lion, “but', 982)
('I suppose there is nothing to do but try it. So get on my back and we', 983)
('will make the attempt.”', 984)
('The Scarecrow sat upon the Lion’s back, and the big beast walked to the', 985)
('edge of the gulf and crouched down.', 986)
('“Why don’t you run and jump?” asked the Scarecrow.', 987)
('“Because that isn’t the way we Lions do these things,” he replied. Then', 988)
('giving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely on the', 989)
('other side. They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it,', 990)
('and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang', 991)
('across the ditch again.', 992)
('Dorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and', 993)
('climbed on the Lion’s back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand.', 994)
('The next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and', 995)
('then, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the other', 996)
('side. The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman, and then', 997)
('they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest,', 998)
('for his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like a big', 999)
('dog that has been running too long.', 1000)
('They found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and', 1001)
('gloomy. After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow', 1002)
('brick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would', 1003)
('come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again. To', 1004)
('add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths', 1005)
('of the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part', 1006)
('of the country that the Kalidahs lived.', 1007)
('“What are the Kalidahs?” asked the girl.', 1008)
('“They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like', 1009)
('tigers,” replied the Lion, “and with claws so long and sharp that they', 1010)
('could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto. I’m terribly', 1011)
('afraid of the Kalidahs.”', 1012)
('“I’m not surprised that you are,” returned Dorothy. “They must be', 1013)
('dreadful beasts.”', 1014)
('The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf', 1015)
('across the road. But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew', 1016)
('at once he could not leap across it.', 1017)
('So they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious', 1018)
('thought the Scarecrow said:', 1019)
('“Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If the Tin Woodman', 1020)
('can chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk', 1021)
('across it easily.”', 1022)
('“That is a first-rate idea,” said the Lion. “One would almost suspect', 1023)
('you had brains in your head, instead of straw.”', 1024)
('The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree', 1025)
('was soon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his strong front', 1026)
('legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big', 1027)
('tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top', 1028)
('branches on the other side.', 1029)
('They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl', 1030)
('made them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them', 1031)
('two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.', 1032)
('“They are the Kalidahs!” said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.', 1033)
('“Quick!” cried the Scarecrow. “Let us cross over.”', 1034)
('So Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman', 1035)
('followed, and the Scarecrow came next. The Lion, although he was', 1036)
('certainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud', 1037)
('and terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over', 1038)
('backward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him', 1039)
('in surprise.', 1040)
('But, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there', 1041)
('were two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed', 1042)
('forward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they', 1043)
('would do next. Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began', 1044)
('to cross the tree. And the Lion said to Dorothy:', 1045)
('“We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp', 1046)
('claws. But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am', 1047)
('alive.”', 1048)
('“Wait a minute!” called the Scarecrow. He had been thinking what was', 1049)
('best to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of', 1050)
('the tree that rested on their side of the ditch. The Tin Woodman began', 1051)
('to use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly', 1052)
('across, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly,', 1053)
('snarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp', 1054)
('rocks at the bottom.', 1055)
('“Well,” said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief, “I see', 1056)
('we are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it, for it', 1057)
('must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive. Those creatures', 1058)
('frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet.”', 1059)
('“Ah,” said the Tin Woodman sadly, “I wish I had a heart to beat.”', 1060)
('This adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of', 1061)
('the forest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had', 1062)
('to ride on the Lion’s back. To their great joy the trees became thinner', 1063)
('the farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon', 1064)
('a broad river, flowing swiftly just before them. On the other side of', 1065)
('the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a', 1066)
('beautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and', 1067)
('all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits. They', 1068)
('were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them.', 1069)
('“How shall we cross the river?” asked Dorothy.', 1070)
('“That is easily done,” replied the Scarecrow. “The Tin Woodman must', 1071)
('build us a raft, so we can float to the other side.”', 1072)
('So the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make', 1073)
('a raft, and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the', 1074)
('riverbank a tree full of fine fruit. This pleased Dorothy, who had', 1075)
('eaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe', 1076)
('fruit.', 1077)
('But it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and', 1078)
('untiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done.', 1079)
('So they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until', 1080)
('the morning; and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good', 1081)
('Wizard Oz, who would soon send her back to her own home again.', 1082)
('Chapter VIII', 1083)
('The Deadly Poppy Field', 1084)
('Our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and', 1085)
('full of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and', 1086)
('plums from the trees beside the river. Behind them was the dark forest', 1087)
('they had passed safely through, although they had suffered many', 1088)
('discouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that', 1089)
('seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.', 1090)
('To be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land.', 1091)
('But the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few', 1092)
('more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready', 1093)
('to start. Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in', 1094)
('her arms. When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly,', 1095)
('for he was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood', 1096)
('upon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their hands', 1097)
('to push the raft through the water.', 1098)
('They got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of', 1099)
('the river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and', 1100)
('farther away from the road of yellow brick. And the water grew so deep', 1101)
('that the long poles would not touch the bottom.', 1102)
('“This is bad,” said the Tin Woodman, “for if we cannot get to the land', 1103)
('we shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West,', 1104)
('and she will enchant us and make us her slaves.”', 1105)
('“And then I should get no brains,” said the Scarecrow.', 1106)
('“And I should get no courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.', 1107)
('“And I should get no heart,” said the Tin Woodman.', 1108)
('“And I should never get back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.', 1109)
('“We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,” the Scarecrow', 1110)
('continued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in', 1111)
('the mud at the bottom of the river. Then, before he could pull it out', 1112)
('again—or let go—the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was', 1113)
('left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.', 1114)
('“Good-bye!” he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave', 1115)
('him. Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered', 1116)
('that he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy’s apron.', 1117)
('Of course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.', 1118)
('“I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,” he thought. “Then,', 1119)
('I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare', 1120)
('the crows, at any rate. But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow', 1121)
('stuck on a pole in the middle of a river. I am afraid I shall never', 1122)
('have any brains, after all!”', 1123)
('Down the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far', 1124)
('behind. Then the Lion said:', 1125)
('“Something must be done to save us. I think I can swim to the shore and', 1126)
('pull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my', 1127)
('tail.”', 1128)
('So he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of', 1129)
('his tail. Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the', 1130)
('shore. It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they', 1131)
('were drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman’s', 1132)
('long pole and helped push the raft to the land.', 1133)
('They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped', 1134)
('off upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had', 1135)
('carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the', 1136)
('Emerald City.', 1137)
('“What shall we do now?” asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on', 1138)
('the grass to let the sun dry him.', 1139)
('“We must get back to the road, in some way,” said Dorothy.', 1140)
('“The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the', 1141)
('road again,” remarked the Lion.', 1142)
('So, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they', 1143)
('started along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had', 1144)
('carried them. It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit', 1145)
('trees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for', 1146)
('the poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.', 1147)
('They walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to', 1148)
('pick a beautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out:', 1149)
('“Look!”', 1150)
('Then they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon', 1151)
('his pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad.', 1152)
('“What can we do to save him?” asked Dorothy.', 1153)
('The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know.', 1154)
('So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow', 1155)
('until a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the', 1156)
('water’s edge.', 1157)
('“Who are you and where are you going?” asked the Stork.', 1158)
('“I am Dorothy,” answered the girl, “and these are my friends, the Tin', 1159)
('Woodman and the Cowardly Lion; and we are going to the Emerald City.”', 1160)
('“This isn’t the road,” said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and', 1161)
('looked sharply at the queer party.', 1162)
('“I know it,” returned Dorothy, “but we have lost the Scarecrow, and are', 1163)
('wondering how we shall get him again.”', 1164)
('“Where is he?” asked the Stork.', 1165)
('“Over there in the river,” answered the little girl.', 1166)
('“If he wasn’t so big and heavy I would get him for you,” remarked the', 1167)
('Stork.', 1168)
('“He isn’t heavy a bit,” said Dorothy eagerly, “for he is stuffed with', 1169)
('straw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever', 1170)
('and ever so much.”', 1171)
('“Well, I’ll try,” said the Stork, “but if I find he is too heavy to', 1172)
('carry I shall have to drop him in the river again.”', 1173)
('So the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to', 1174)
('where the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole. Then the Stork with her', 1175)
('great claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into', 1176)
('the air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin', 1177)
('Woodman and Toto were sitting.', 1178)
('When the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so', 1179)
('happy that he hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they', 1180)
('walked along he sang “Tol-de-ri-de-oh!” at every step, he felt so gay.', 1181)
('“I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever,” he said,', 1182)
('“but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find', 1183)
('the Stork again and do her some kindness in return.”', 1184)
('“That’s all right,” said the Stork, who was flying along beside them.', 1185)
('“I always like to help anyone in trouble. But I must go now, for my', 1186)
('babies are waiting in the nest for me. I hope you will find the Emerald', 1187)
('City and that Oz will help you.”', 1188)
('“Thank you,” replied Dorothy, and then the kind Stork flew into the air', 1189)
('and was soon out of sight.', 1190)
('They walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored', 1191)
('birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that', 1192)
('the ground was carpeted with them. There were big yellow and white and', 1193)
('blue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies,', 1194)
('which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy’s eyes.', 1195)
('“Aren’t they beautiful?” the girl asked, as she breathed in the spicy', 1196)
('scent of the bright flowers.', 1197)
('“I suppose so,” answered the Scarecrow. “When I have brains, I shall', 1198)
('probably like them better.”', 1199)
('“If I only had a heart, I should love them,” added the Tin Woodman.', 1200)
('“I always did like flowers,” said the Lion. “They seem so helpless and', 1201)
('frail. But there are none in the forest so bright as these.”', 1202)
('They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer', 1203)
('and fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the', 1204)
('midst of a great meadow of poppies. Now it is well known that when', 1205)
('there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that', 1206)
('anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried', 1207)
('away from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever. But', 1208)
('Dorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red', 1209)
('flowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy', 1210)
('and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.', 1211)
('But the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.', 1212)
('“We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,”', 1213)
('he said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him. So they kept walking until', 1214)
('Dorothy could stand no longer. Her eyes closed in spite of herself and', 1215)
('she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.', 1216)
('“What shall we do?” asked the Tin Woodman.', 1217)
('“If we leave her here she will die,” said the Lion. “The smell of the', 1218)
('flowers is killing us all. I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and', 1219)
('the dog is asleep already.”', 1220)
('It was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress. But the', 1221)
('Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not', 1222)
('troubled by the scent of the flowers.', 1223)
('“Run fast,” said the Scarecrow to the Lion, “and get out of this deadly', 1224)
('flower bed as soon as you can. We will bring the little girl with us,', 1225)
('but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.”', 1226)
('So the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go.', 1227)
('In a moment he was out of sight.', 1228)
('“Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her,” said the Scarecrow.', 1229)
('So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy’s lap, and then they', 1230)
('made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms', 1231)
('and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.', 1232)
('On and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly', 1233)
('flowers that surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of', 1234)
('the river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast', 1235)
('asleep among the poppies. The flowers had been too strong for the huge', 1236)
('beast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance', 1237)
('from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in', 1238)

('The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and', 1254)
('turning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange', 1255)
('beast come bounding over the grass toward them. It was, indeed, a great', 1256)

('for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open,', 1258)
('showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of', 1259)
('fire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the', 1260)
('beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he', 1261)
('knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty,', 1262)

('quick blow that cut the beast’s head clean off from its body, and it', 1265)
('rolled over at his feet in two pieces.', 1266)
('The field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short;', 1267)
('and coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice:', 1268)

('heart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a', 1271)
('friend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.”', 1272)
('“Only a mouse!” cried the little animal, indignantly. “Why, I am a', 1273)
('Queen—the Queen of all the Field Mice!”', 1274)

('“Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage', 1281)
('to escape the great Wildcat?” They all bowed so low to the little Queen', 1282)
('that they almost stood upon their heads.', 1283)
('“This funny tin man,” she answered, “killed the Wildcat and saved my', 1284)

('scampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep, and', 1288)
('seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped', 1289)
('right into the middle of the group. Toto had always loved to chase mice', 1290)
('when he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.', 1291)
('But the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight,', 1292)
('while he called to the mice, “Come back! Come back! Toto shall not hurt', 1293)

('At this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from underneath a', 1295)

('“I will not let him,” said the Woodman; “so do not be afraid.”', 1298)

('“Is there anything we can do,” it asked, “to repay you for saving the', 1303)
('life of our Queen?”', 1304)
('“Nothing that I know of,” answered the Woodman; but the Scarecrow, who', 1305)
('had been trying to think, but could not because his head was stuffed', 1306)
('with straw, said, quickly, “Oh, yes; you can save our friend, the', 1307)
('Cowardly Lion, who is asleep in the poppy bed.”', 1308)
('“A Lion!” cried the little Queen. “Why, he would eat us all up.”', 1309)
('“Oh, no,” declared the Scarecrow; “this Lion is a coward.”', 1310)
('“Really?” asked the Mouse.', 1311)
('“He says so himself,” answered the Scarecrow, “and he would never hurt', 1312)
('anyone who is our friend. If you will help us to save him I promise', 1313)
('that he shall treat you all with kindness.”', 1314)
('“Very well,” said the Queen, “we trust you. But what shall we do?”', 1315)
('“Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to', 1316)
('obey you?”', 1317)
('“Oh, yes; there are thousands,” she replied.', 1318)
('“Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let each', 1319)
('one bring a long piece of string.”', 1320)
('The Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at', 1321)

('away in every direction as fast as possible.', 1323)
('“Now,” said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman, “you must go to those', 1324)
('trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the Lion.”', 1325)
('So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon', 1326)
('made a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all', 1327)
('the leaves and branches. He fastened it together with wooden pegs and', 1328)
('made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk. So fast', 1329)
('and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the', 1330)
('truck was all ready for them.', 1331)
('They came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big', 1332)
('mice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a', 1333)
('piece of string in his mouth. It was about this time that Dorothy woke', 1334)
('from her long sleep and opened her eyes. She was greatly astonished to', 1335)
('find herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing', 1336)
('around and looking at her timidly. But the Scarecrow told her about', 1337)
('everything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said:', 1338)
('“Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen.”', 1339)
('Dorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a curtsy, after which she', 1340)
('became quite friendly with the little girl.', 1341)
('The Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the', 1342)
('truck, using the strings they had brought. One end of a string was tied', 1343)
('around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck. Of course', 1344)
('the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to', 1345)
('draw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed, they were able to', 1346)
('pull it quite easily. Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit', 1347)
('on it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place', 1348)
('where the Lion lay asleep.', 1349)
('After a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed', 1350)
('to get him up on the truck. Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people', 1351)
('the order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies', 1352)
('too long they also would fall asleep.', 1353)
('At first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir', 1354)
('the heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed', 1355)
('from behind, and they got along better. Soon they rolled the Lion out', 1356)
('of the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet,', 1357)
('fresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.', 1358)
('Dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving', 1359)
('her companion from death. She had grown so fond of the big Lion she was', 1360)
('glad he had been rescued.', 1361)
('Then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away', 1362)
('through the grass to their homes. The Queen of the Mice was the last to', 1363)
('leave.', 1364)
('“If ever you need us again,” she said, “come out into the field and', 1365)
('call, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance. Good-bye!”', 1366)
('“Good-bye!” they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while Dorothy', 1367)
('held Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.', 1368)
('After this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken; and', 1369)
('the Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by, which she', 1370)
('ate for her dinner.', 1371)
('Chapter X', 1372)
('The Guardian of the Gate', 1373)
('It was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain', 1374)
('among the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance;', 1375)
('but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad', 1376)
('to find himself still alive.', 1377)
('“I ran as fast as I could,” he said, sitting down and yawning, “but the', 1378)
('flowers were too strong for me. How did you get me out?”', 1379)
('Then they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved', 1380)
('him from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:', 1381)
('“I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little', 1382)
('things as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as', 1383)
('mice have saved my life. How strange it all is! But, comrades, what', 1384)
('shall we do now?”', 1385)
('“We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,” said', 1386)
('Dorothy, “and then we can keep on to the Emerald City.”', 1387)
('So, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again,', 1388)
('they all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through', 1389)
('the soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road', 1390)
('of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the', 1391)
('Great Oz dwelt.', 1392)
('The road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was', 1393)
('beautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far', 1394)
('behind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades.', 1395)
('Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were', 1396)
('painted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer', 1397)
('evidently lived, that also was painted green. They passed by several of', 1398)
('these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the', 1399)
('doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no', 1400)
('one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of', 1401)
('which they were very much afraid. The people were all dressed in', 1402)
('clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like', 1403)
('those of the Munchkins.', 1404)
('“This must be the Land of Oz,” said Dorothy, “and we are surely getting', 1405)
('near the Emerald City.”', 1406)
('“Yes,” answered the Scarecrow. “Everything is green here, while in the', 1407)
('country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color. But the people do', 1408)
('not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I’m afraid we shall be', 1409)
('unable to find a place to pass the night.”', 1410)
('“I should like something to eat besides fruit,” said the girl, “and I’m', 1411)
('sure Toto is nearly starved. Let us stop at the next house and talk to', 1412)
('the people.”', 1413)
('So, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up', 1414)
('to the door and knocked.', 1415)
('A woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, “What do you', 1416)
('want, child, and why is that great Lion with you?”', 1417)
('“We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,” answered', 1418)
('Dorothy; “and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you', 1419)
('for the world.”', 1420)
('“Is he tame?” asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.', 1421)
('“Oh, yes,” said the girl, “and he is a great coward, too. He will be', 1422)
('more afraid of you than you are of him.”', 1423)
('“Well,” said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep', 1424)
('at the Lion, “if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you', 1425)
('some supper and a place to sleep.”', 1426)
('So they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two', 1427)
('children and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the', 1428)
('couch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a', 1429)
('company, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:', 1430)
('“Where are you all going?”', 1431)
('“To the Emerald City,” said Dorothy, “to see the Great Oz.”', 1432)
('“Oh, indeed!” exclaimed the man. “Are you sure that Oz will see you?”', 1433)
('“Why not?” she replied.', 1434)
('“Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence. I', 1435)
('have been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and', 1436)
('wonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz,', 1437)
('nor do I know of any living person who has seen him.”', 1438)
('“Does he never go out?” asked the Scarecrow.', 1439)
('“Never. He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace,', 1440)
('and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.”', 1441)
('“What is he like?” asked the girl.', 1442)
('“That is hard to tell,” said the man thoughtfully. “You see, Oz is a', 1443)
('Great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he', 1444)
('looks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say', 1445)
('he looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a', 1446)
('brownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is,', 1447)
('when he is in his own form, no living person can tell.”', 1448)
('“That is very strange,” said Dorothy, “but we must try, in some way, to', 1449)
('see him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.”', 1450)
('“Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?” asked the man.', 1451)
('“I want him to give me some brains,” said the Scarecrow eagerly.', 1452)
('“Oh, Oz could do that easily enough,” declared the man. “He has more', 1453)
('brains than he needs.”', 1454)
('“And I want him to give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.', 1455)
('“That will not trouble him,” continued the man, “for Oz has a large', 1456)
('collection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.”', 1457)
('“And I want him to give me courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.', 1458)
('“Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room,” said the man,', 1459)
('“which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running', 1460)
('over. He will be glad to give you some.”', 1461)
('“And I want him to send me back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.', 1462)
('“Where is Kansas?” asked the man, with surprise.', 1463)
('“I don’t know,” replied Dorothy sorrowfully, “but it is my home, and', 1464)
('I’m sure it’s somewhere.”', 1465)
('“Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find', 1466)
('Kansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a', 1467)
('hard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he', 1468)
('usually has his own way. But what do YOU want?” he continued, speaking', 1469)
('to Toto. Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not', 1470)
('speak.', 1471)
('The woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered', 1472)
('around the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of', 1473)
('scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal.', 1474)
('The Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it', 1475)
('was made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions. The', 1476)
('Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all. Toto ate a little of', 1477)
('everything, and was glad to get a good supper again.', 1478)
('The woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside', 1479)
('her, while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be', 1480)
('disturbed. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and', 1481)
('kept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep.', 1482)
('The next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way,', 1483)
('and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them.', 1484)
('“That must be the Emerald City,” said Dorothy.', 1485)
('As they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it', 1486)
('seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels. Yet it', 1487)
('was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the', 1488)
('City. It was high and thick and of a bright green color.', 1489)
('In front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big', 1490)
('gate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even', 1491)
('the painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.', 1492)
('There was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and', 1493)
('heard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly', 1494)
('open, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched', 1495)
('room, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.', 1496)
('Before them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins. He', 1497)
('was clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin', 1498)
('was of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box.', 1499)
('When he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, “What do you wish', 1500)
('in the Emerald City?”', 1501)
('“We came here to see the Great Oz,” said Dorothy.', 1502)

('over.', 1504)
('“It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,” he said,', 1505)
('shaking his head in perplexity. “He is powerful and terrible, and if', 1506)
('you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of', 1507)
('the Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.”', 1508)
('“But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,” replied the', 1509)
('Scarecrow; “it is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good', 1510)

('“So he is,” said the green man, “and he rules the Emerald City wisely', 1512)
('and well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from', 1513)
('curiosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his', 1514)
('face. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the', 1515)
('Great Oz I must take you to his Palace. But first you must put on the', 1516)
('spectacles.”', 1517)
('“Why?” asked Dorothy.', 1518)
('“Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the', 1519)
('Emerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wear', 1520)
('spectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it', 1521)
('when the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock', 1522)
('them.”', 1523)
('He opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with', 1524)
('spectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in', 1525)
('them. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit', 1526)
('Dorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands', 1527)
('fastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they', 1528)
('were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the', 1529)
('Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Dorothy', 1530)
('could not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish', 1531)
('to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.', 1532)
('Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin', 1533)
('Woodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast', 1534)
('with the key.', 1535)
('Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he', 1536)
('was ready to show them to the Palace. Taking a big golden key from a', 1537)

('green.', 1550)
('There were many people—men, women, and children—walking about, and', 1551)
('these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins. They', 1552)
('looked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering', 1553)
('eyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when', 1554)
('they saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them. Many shops stood in the', 1555)
('street, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green. Green candy', 1556)
('and green pop corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green', 1557)
('hats, and green clothes of all sorts. At one place a man was selling', 1558)
('green lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that', 1559)

('The Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came', 1564)
('to a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the', 1565)

('She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led', 1609)
('to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant', 1610)
('part of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the', 1611)
('Scarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood', 1612)
('stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It', 1613)
('would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he', 1614)
('remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web', 1615)
('in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most', 1616)

('force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not', 1618)
('being able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down', 1619)
('to make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would have', 1620)

('The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch', 1625)

('“Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?”', 1636)
('“Of course,” answered the girl, “if he will see me.”', 1637)
('“Oh, he will see you,” said the soldier who had taken her message to', 1638)
('the Wizard, “although he does not like to have people ask to see him.', 1639)

('your silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about', 1642)

('Just then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, “That is the', 1645)
('signal. You must go into the Throne Room alone.”', 1646)
('She opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found', 1647)
('herself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high', 1648)

('great light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a', 1651)

('But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble', 1653)
('that stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and', 1654)
('sparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair', 1655)
('was an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs', 1656)
('whatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose', 1657)
('and mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.', 1658)
('As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly', 1659)
('and looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and', 1660)
('Dorothy heard a voice say:', 1661)
('“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?”', 1662)
('It was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big', 1663)
('Head; so she took courage and answered:', 1664)
('“I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.”', 1665)
('The eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the', 1666)
('voice:', 1667)

('“That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me', 1672)
('good-bye and sent me to you,” said the girl.', 1673)
('Again the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the', 1674)
('truth. Then Oz asked, “What do you wish me to do?”', 1675)
('“Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,” she', 1676)
('answered earnestly. “I don’t like your country, although it is so', 1677)

('The eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and', 1680)
('down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see', 1681)
('every part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.', 1682)
('“Why should I do this for you?” asked Oz.', 1683)
('“Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard', 1684)
('and I am only a little girl.”', 1685)
('“But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,” said', 1686)
('Oz.', 1687)
('“That just happened,” returned Dorothy simply; “I could not help it.”', 1688)
('“Well,” said the Head, “I will give you my answer. You have no right to', 1689)

('return. In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets. If', 1691)
('you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do', 1692)
('something for me first. Help me and I will help you.”', 1693)
('“What must I do?” asked the girl.', 1694)
('“Kill the Wicked Witch of the West,” answered Oz.', 1695)
('“But I cannot!” exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.', 1696)
('“You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which', 1697)
('bear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all', 1698)
('this land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to', 1699)
('Kansas—but not before.”', 1700)
('The little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the', 1701)
('eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz', 1702)
('felt that she could help him if she would.', 1703)
('“I never killed anything, willingly,” she sobbed. “Even if I wanted to,', 1704)
('how could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and Terrible,', 1705)
('cannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?”', 1706)
('“I do not know,” said the Head; “but that is my answer, and until the', 1707)
('Wicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again. Remember', 1708)
('that the Witch is Wicked—tremendously Wicked—and ought to be killed.', 1709)
('Now go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task.”', 1710)
('Sorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion', 1711)

('that I can never do.”', 1715)
('Her friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her; so Dorothy', 1716)

('“Come with me, for Oz has sent for you.”', 1721)
('So the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne', 1722)

('Now the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had', 1732)
('told him of, was much astonished; but he answered her bravely.', 1733)
('“I am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw. Therefore I have no brains,', 1734)
('and I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead', 1735)

('“Why should I do this for you?” asked the Lady.', 1738)
('“Because you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me,”', 1739)
('answered the Scarecrow.', 1740)
('“I never grant favors without some return,” said Oz; “but this much I', 1741)
('will promise. If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West, I', 1742)
('will bestow upon you a great many brains, and such good brains that you', 1743)
('will be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz.”', 1744)
('“I thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch,” said the Scarecrow, in', 1745)
('surprise.', 1746)
('“So I did. I don’t care who kills her. But until she is dead I will not', 1747)
('grant your wish. Now go, and do not seek me again until you have earned', 1748)
('the brains you so greatly desire.”', 1749)
('The Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what', 1750)
('Oz had said; and Dorothy was surprised to find that the Great Wizard', 1751)
('was not a Head, as she had seen him, but a lovely Lady.', 1752)
('“All the same,” said the Scarecrow, “she needs a heart as much as the', 1753)
('Tin Woodman.”', 1754)
('On the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin', 1755)
('Woodman and said:', 1756)
('“Oz has sent for you. Follow me.”', 1757)
('So the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the great Throne Room. He', 1758)
('did not know whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head, but he', 1759)
('hoped it would be the lovely Lady. “For,” he said to himself, “if it is', 1760)

('said to be kindly hearted.”', 1764)
('But when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the', 1765)
('Head nor the Lady, for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast.', 1766)
('It was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly', 1767)
('strong enough to hold its weight. The Beast had a head like that of a', 1768)
('rhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face. There were five long', 1769)
('arms growing out of its body, and it also had five long, slim legs.', 1770)
('Thick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more', 1771)
('dreadful-looking monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the', 1772)
('Tin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud', 1773)
('and fast from terror. But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all', 1774)
('afraid, although he was much disappointed.', 1775)
('“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,” spoke the Beast, in a voice that was', 1776)
('one great roar. “Who are you, and why do you seek me?”', 1777)
('“I am a Woodman, and made of tin. Therefore I have no heart, and cannot', 1778)

('“Why should I do this?” demanded the Beast.', 1780)
('“Because I ask it, and you alone can grant my request,” answered the', 1781)
('Woodman.', 1782)
('Oz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly: “If you indeed desire a', 1783)

('“Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West,” replied the Beast.', 1786)

('biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz.”', 1788)
('So the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and', 1789)
('tell them of the terrible Beast he had seen. They all wondered greatly', 1790)
('at the many forms the Great Wizard could take upon himself, and the', 1791)

('his surprise, that before the throne was a Ball of Fire, so fierce and', 1803)
('glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it. His first thought was', 1804)
('that Oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up; but when he', 1805)
('tried to go nearer, the heat was so intense that it singed his', 1806)
('whiskers, and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door.', 1807)
('Then a low, quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire, and these were the', 1808)

('“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?”', 1810)
('And the Lion answered, “I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything. I', 1811)

('“Because of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power to', 1815)
('grant my request,” answered the Lion.', 1816)
('The Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the voice said, “Bring', 1817)

('courage. But as long as the Witch lives, you must remain a coward.”', 1819)
('The Lion was angry at this speech, but could say nothing in reply, and', 1820)

('furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room. He was glad', 1822)
('to find his friends waiting for him, and told them of his terrible', 1823)

('“What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy sadly.', 1825)

('would make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used', 2381)
('all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any', 2382)

('“You have plenty of courage, I am sure,” answered Oz. “All you need is', 2650)

('So the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw. Then he', 2700)

('thoroughly, he filled the top of the Scarecrow’s head with the mixture', 2703)

('“It is, indeed!” replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased. “But is', 2732)

('then replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together where it', 2735)

('For three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz. These were sad days for', 2773)

('contented. The Scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his', 2775)

('understand them but himself. When the Tin Woodman walked about he felt', 2777)
('his heart rattling around in his breast; and he told Dorothy he had', 2778)
('discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had', 2779)

('desert, and then it should be easy to find your way home.”', 2792)
('“How can I cross the desert?” she inquired.', 2793)
('“Well, I’ll tell you what I think,” said the little man. “You see, when', 2794)
('I came to this country it was in a balloon. You also came through the', 2795)
('air, being carried by a cyclone. So I believe the best way to get', 2796)
('across the desert will be through the air. Now, it is quite beyond my', 2797)
('powers to make a cyclone; but I’ve been thinking the matter over, and I', 2798)
('believe I can make a balloon.”', 2799)
('“How?” asked Dorothy.', 2800)
('“A balloon,” said Oz, “is made of silk, which is coated with glue to', 2801)
('keep the gas in it. I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will be', 2802)
('no trouble to make the balloon. But in all this country there is no gas', 2803)
('to fill the balloon with, to make it float.”', 2804)
('“If it won’t float,” remarked Dorothy, “it will be of no use to us.”', 2805)
('“True,” answered Oz. “But there is another way to make it float, which', 2806)
('is to fill it with hot air. Hot air isn’t as good as gas, for if the', 2807)
('air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, and we', 2808)
('should be lost.”', 2809)
('“We!” exclaimed the girl. “Are you going with me?”', 2810)
('“Yes, of course,” replied Oz. “I am tired of being such a humbug. If I', 2811)
('should go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a', 2812)
('Wizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them.', 2813)
('So I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome.', 2814)
('I’d much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again.”', 2815)
('“I shall be glad to have your company,” said Dorothy.', 2816)
('“Thank you,” he answered. “Now, if you will help me sew the silk', 2817)
('together, we will begin to work on our balloon.”', 2818)
('So Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips', 2819)
('of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together. First', 2820)
('there was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and', 2821)
('then a strip of emerald green; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon', 2822)
('in different shades of the color about them. It took three days to sew', 2823)
('all the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of', 2824)
('green silk more than twenty feet long.', 2825)
('Then Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it', 2826)
('airtight, after which he announced that the balloon was ready.', 2827)
('“But we must have a basket to ride in,” he said. So he sent the soldier', 2828)
('with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he fastened', 2829)
('with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon.', 2830)
('When it was all ready, Oz sent word to his people that he was going to', 2831)
('make a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds. The', 2832)
('news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the', 2833)
('wonderful sight.', 2834)
('Oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace, and the', 2835)
('people gazed upon it with much curiosity. The Tin Woodman had chopped a', 2836)
('big pile of wood, and now he made a fire of it, and Oz held the bottom', 2837)
('of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it', 2838)
('would be caught in the silken bag. Gradually the balloon swelled out', 2839)
('and rose into the air, until finally the basket just touched the', 2840)
('ground.', 2841)
('Then Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice:', 2842)

('I should like to start as soon as possible.”', 2974)
('“We shall go tomorrow morning,” returned the Scarecrow. “So now let us', 2975)

('Chapter XIX', 2977)
('Attacked by the Fighting Trees', 2978)
('The next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye, and', 2979)
('they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had', 2980)
('walked with them as far as the gate. When the Guardian of the Gate saw', 2981)
('them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City', 2982)
('to get into new trouble. But he at once unlocked their spectacles,', 2983)
('which he put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to', 2984)
('carry with them.', 2985)
('“You are now our ruler,” he said to the Scarecrow; “so you must come', 2986)
('back to us as soon as possible.”', 2987)
('“I certainly shall if I am able,” the Scarecrow replied; “but I must', 2988)
('help Dorothy to get home, first.”', 2989)
('As Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said:', 2990)
('“I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City, and everyone has', 2991)
('been good to me. I cannot tell you how grateful I am.”', 2992)
('“Don’t try, my dear,” he answered. “We should like to keep you with us,', 2993)
('but if it is your wish to return to Kansas, I hope you will find a', 2994)
('way.” He then opened the gate of the outer wall, and they walked forth', 2995)
('and started upon their journey.', 2996)
('The sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the', 2997)
('Land of the South. They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed', 2998)
('and chatted together. Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of', 2999)
('getting home, and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be of', 3000)
('use to her. As for the Lion, he sniffed the fresh air with delight and', 3001)
('whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country', 3002)
('again, while Toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies,', 3003)
('barking merrily all the time.', 3004)
('“City life does not agree with me at all,” remarked the Lion, as they', 3005)

('there, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how', 3007)
('courageous I have grown.”', 3008)
('They now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City. All they', 3009)
('could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and', 3010)
('high up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz.', 3011)
('“Oz was not such a bad Wizard, after all,” said the Tin Woodman, as he', 3012)
('felt his heart rattling around in his breast.', 3013)

('even if he was a bad Wizard.', 3020)
('The first day’s journey was through the green fields and bright flowers', 3021)

('rested very well indeed.', 3024)
('In the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood. There', 3025)
('was no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and', 3026)
('left as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change', 3027)
('the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost. So they looked', 3028)
('for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.', 3029)
('The Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with', 3030)
('such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass', 3031)
('underneath. So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under', 3032)
('the first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next', 3033)
('minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his', 3034)
('fellow travelers.', 3035)
('This did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked', 3036)
('rather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.', 3037)
('“Here is another space between the trees,” called the Lion.', 3038)

('“This is strange,” exclaimed Dorothy. “What shall we do?”', 3042)
('“The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our', 3043)
('journey,” remarked the Lion.', 3044)
('“I believe I will try it myself,” said the Woodman, and shouldering his', 3045)
('axe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so', 3046)
('roughly. When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped', 3047)
('at it so fiercely that he cut it in two. At once the tree began shaking', 3048)
('all its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under', 3049)
('it.', 3050)
('“Come on!” he shouted to the others. “Be quick!” They all ran forward', 3051)
('and passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught', 3052)
('by a small branch and shaken until he howled. But the Woodman promptly', 3053)
('chopped off the branch and set the little dog free.', 3054)
('The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they', 3055)
('made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down', 3056)
('their branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the', 3057)
('forest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out', 3058)
('of it.', 3059)
('The four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came', 3060)
('to the farther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found', 3061)
('before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was', 3062)
('smooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads.', 3063)
('“What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy.', 3064)
('“I will make a ladder,” said the Tin Woodman, “for we certainly must', 3065)

('Chapter XX', 3067)
('The Dainty China Country', 3068)
('While the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the', 3069)
('forest Dorothy lay down and slept, for she was tired by the long walk.', 3070)
('The Lion also curled himself up to sleep and Toto lay beside him.', 3071)

('“I cannot think why this wall is here, nor what it is made of.”', 3073)
('“Rest your brains and do not worry about the wall,” replied the', 3074)
('Woodman. “When we have climbed over it, we shall know what is on the', 3075)

('After a time the ladder was finished. It looked clumsy, but the Tin', 3077)
('Woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose. The', 3078)
('Scarecrow waked Dorothy and the Lion and Toto, and told them that the', 3079)
('ladder was ready. The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first, but he was', 3080)
('so awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from', 3081)
('falling off. When he got his head over the top of the wall the', 3082)
('Scarecrow said, “Oh, my!”', 3083)
('“Go on,” exclaimed Dorothy.', 3084)
('So the Scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the', 3085)

('Then Toto came up, and immediately began to bark, but Dorothy made him', 3088)
('be still.', 3089)
('The Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; but', 3090)
('both of them cried, “Oh, my!” as soon as they looked over the wall.', 3091)
('When they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall, they looked', 3092)
('down and saw a strange sight.', 3093)
('Before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and', 3094)
('shining and white as the bottom of a big platter. Scattered around were', 3095)
('many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors.', 3096)
('These houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as', 3097)
('high as Dorothy’s waist. There were also pretty little barns, with', 3098)
('china fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs', 3099)
('and chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups.', 3100)
('But the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer', 3101)
('country. There were milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored', 3102)
('bodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most', 3103)
('gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in', 3104)
('knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and', 3105)
('golden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jeweled crowns upon', 3106)
('their heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns', 3107)
('in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall,', 3108)
('pointed caps. And, strangest of all, these people were all made of', 3109)
('china, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest of', 3110)
('them was no higher than Dorothy’s knee.', 3111)
('No one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little', 3112)
('purple china dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and', 3113)
('barked at them in a tiny voice, afterwards running away again.', 3114)
('“How shall we get down?” asked Dorothy.', 3115)
('They found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the', 3116)
('Scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that', 3117)
('the hard floor would not hurt their feet. Of course they took pains not', 3118)
('to light on his head and get the pins in their feet. When all were', 3119)
('safely down they picked up the Scarecrow, whose body was quite', 3120)
('flattened out, and patted his straw into shape again.', 3121)
('“We must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side,”', 3122)
('said Dorothy, “for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except', 3123)
('due South.”', 3124)
('They began walking through the country of the china people, and the', 3125)
('first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow. As', 3126)
('they drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool,', 3127)
('the pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china', 3128)
('ground with a great clatter.', 3129)
('Dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and', 3130)
('that the pail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor', 3131)
('milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow.', 3132)
('“There!” cried the milkmaid angrily. “See what you have done! My cow', 3133)
('has broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender’s shop and have', 3134)
('it glued on again. What do you mean by coming here and frightening my', 3135)
('cow?”', 3136)
('“I’m very sorry,” returned Dorothy. “Please forgive us.”', 3137)
('But the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer. She', 3138)
('picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping', 3139)
('on three legs. As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful', 3140)
('glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked', 3141)
('elbow close to her side.', 3142)
('Dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap.', 3143)
('“We must be very careful here,” said the kind-hearted Woodman, “or we', 3144)
('may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it.”', 3145)
('A little farther on Dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young', 3146)
('Princess, who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run', 3147)
('away.', 3148)
('Dorothy wanted to see more of the Princess, so she ran after her. But', 3149)
('the china girl cried out:', 3150)
('“Don’t chase me! Don’t chase me!”', 3151)
('She had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said,', 3152)
('“Why not?”', 3153)
('“Because,” answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distance away,', 3154)
('“if I run I may fall down and break myself.”', 3155)
('“But could you not be mended?” asked the girl.', 3156)
('“Oh, yes; but one is never so pretty after being mended, you know,”', 3157)
('replied the Princess.', 3158)
('“I suppose not,” said Dorothy.', 3159)
('“Now there is Mr. Joker, one of our clowns,” continued the china lady,', 3160)
('“who is always trying to stand upon his head. He has broken himself so', 3161)
('often that he is mended in a hundred places, and doesn’t look at all', 3162)
('pretty. Here he comes now, so you can see for yourself.”', 3163)
('Indeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy', 3164)
('could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and', 3165)
('green he was completely covered with cracks, running every which way', 3166)
('and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places.', 3167)
('The Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out his', 3168)

('“My lady fair,', 3170)

('At poor old Mr. Joker?', 3172)
('You’re quite as stiff', 3173)

('You’d eaten up a poker!”', 3175)
('“Be quiet, sir!” said the Princess. “Can’t you see these are strangers,', 3176)
('and should be treated with respect?”', 3177)
('“Well, that’s respect, I expect,” declared the Clown, and immediately', 3178)
('stood upon his head.', 3179)
('“Don’t mind Mr. Joker,” said the Princess to Dorothy. “He is', 3180)
('considerably cracked in his head, and that makes him foolish.”', 3181)
('“Oh, I don’t mind him a bit,” said Dorothy. “But you are so beautiful,”', 3182)
('she continued, “that I am sure I could love you dearly. Won’t you let', 3183)
('me carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt Em’s mantel? I could', 3184)

('“That would make me very unhappy,” answered the china Princess. “You', 3186)

('around as we please. But whenever any of us are taken away our joints', 3188)
('at once stiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty. Of', 3189)
('course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and', 3190)

('“So I’ll just say good-bye.”', 3194)
('“Good-bye,” replied the Princess.', 3195)
('They walked carefully through the china country. The little animals and', 3196)
('all the people scampered out of their way, fearing the strangers would', 3197)
('break them, and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other', 3198)
('side of the country and came to another china wall.', 3199)
('It was not so high as the first, however, and by standing upon the', 3200)
('Lion’s back they all managed to scramble to the top. Then the Lion', 3201)
('gathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall; but just as he', 3202)
('jumped, he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to', 3203)
('pieces.', 3204)
('“That was too bad,” said Dorothy, “but really I think we were lucky in', 3205)

('After climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves', 3213)
('in a disagreeable country, full of bogs and marshes and covered with', 3214)
('tall, rank grass. It was difficult to walk without falling into muddy', 3215)
('holes, for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight. However,', 3216)
('by carefully picking their way, they got safely along until they', 3217)
('reached solid ground. But here the country seemed wilder than ever, and', 3218)
('after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered', 3219)
('another forest, where the trees were bigger and older than any they had', 3220)

('whimpered a little, but none of the others was frightened, and they', 3237)
('kept along the well-trodden path until they came to an opening in the', 3238)
('wood, in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety. There', 3239)
('were tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the', 3240)
('others in the natural history, and for a moment Dorothy was afraid. But', 3241)
('the Lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting, and he', 3242)
('judged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble.', 3243)

('up to the Lion and bowed, saying:', 3246)
('“Welcome, O King of Beasts! You have come in good time to fight our', 3247)

('“We are all threatened,” answered the tiger, “by a fierce enemy which', 3250)
('has lately come into this forest. It is a most tremendous monster, like', 3251)

('coarse black hair. It had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a', 3276)
('foot long; but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as', 3277)
('slender as a wasp’s waist. This gave the Lion a hint of the best way to', 3278)
('attack the creature, and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep', 3279)
('than awake, he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the', 3280)
('monster’s back. Then, with one blow of his heavy paw, all armed with', 3281)
('sharp claws, he knocked the spider’s head from its body. Jumping down,', 3282)
('he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling, when he knew it was', 3283)

('The Lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were', 3285)

('stretched out until the top of the head, where it was flat, struck the', 3314)
('Scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling, over and over, down the', 3315)
('hill. Almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body, and', 3316)
('the man laughed harshly as he said, “It isn’t as easy as you think!”', 3317)

('“Well, it isn’t _picked_ at all,” Alice explained: “it’s _ground_—”', 2613)
('“How many acres of ground?” said the White Queen. “You mustn’t leave', 2614)
('out so many things.”', 2615)
('“Fan her head!” the Red Queen anxiously interrupted. “She’ll be', 2616)

('with bunches of leaves, till she had to beg them to leave off, it blew', 2618)
('her hair about so.', 2619)
('“She’s all right again now,” said the Red Queen. “Do you know', 2620)

('“Fiddle-de-dee’s not English,” Alice replied gravely.', 2622)
('“Who ever said it was?” said the Red Queen.', 2623)
('Alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time. “If you’ll', 2624)

('But the Red Queen drew herself up rather stiffly, and said “Queens', 2627)

('“The cause of lightning,” Alice said very decidedly, for she felt quite', 2632)
('certain about this, “is the thunder—no, no!” she hastily corrected', 2633)

('“It’s too late to correct it,” said the Red Queen: “when you’ve once', 2635)

('“Which reminds me—” the White Queen said, looking down and nervously', 2637)
('clasping and unclasping her hands, “we had _such_ a thunderstorm last', 2638)

('Alice was puzzled. “In _our_ country,” she remarked, “there’s only one', 2640)

('The Red Queen said, “That’s a poor thin way of doing things. Now', 2642)
('_here_, we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time, and', 2643)
('sometimes in the winter we take as many as five nights together—for', 2644)
('warmth, you know.”', 2645)
('“Are five nights warmer than one night, then?” Alice ventured to ask.', 2646)
('“Five times as warm, of course.”', 2647)
('“But they should be five times as _cold_, by the same rule—”', 2648)
('“Just so!” cried the Red Queen. “Five times as warm, _and_ five times', 2649)
('as cold—just as I’m five times as rich as you are, _and_ five times as', 2650)
('clever!”', 2651)
('Alice sighed and gave it up. “It’s exactly like a riddle with no', 2652)

('The White Queen looked timidly at Alice, who felt she _ought_ to say', 2677)
('something kind, but really couldn’t think of anything at the moment.', 2678)
('“She never was really well brought up,” the Red Queen went on: “but', 2679)

('“A little kindness—and putting her hair in papers—would do wonders with', 2682)

('snoring loud.', 2698)
('“What _am_ I to do?” exclaimed Alice, looking about in great', 2699)
('perplexity, as first one round head, and then the other, rolled down', 2700)
('from her shoulder, and lay like a heavy lump in her lap. “I don’t think', 2701)

('The snoring got more distinct every minute, and sounded more like a', 2707)

('eagerly that, when the two great heads vanished from her lap, she', 2709)
('hardly missed them.', 2710)
('She was standing before an arched doorway over which were the words', 2711)

('Alice knocked and rang in vain for a long time, but at last, a very old', 2722)

('“What is it, now?” the Frog said in a deep hoarse whisper.', 2725)
('Alice turned round, ready to find fault with anybody. “Where’s the', 2726)

('“Which door?” said the Frog.', 2728)
('Alice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which he', 2729)
('spoke. “_This_ door, of course!”', 2730)
('The Frog looked at the door with his large dull eyes for a minute: then', 2731)
('he went nearer and rubbed it with his thumb, as if he were trying', 2732)
('whether the paint would come off; then he looked at Alice.', 2733)
('“To answer the door?” he said. “What’s it been asking of?” He was so', 2734)
('hoarse that Alice could scarcely hear him.', 2735)
('“I don’t know what you mean,” she said.', 2736)
('“I talks English, doesn’t I?” the Frog went on. “Or are you deaf? What', 2737)

('“Nothing!” Alice said impatiently. “I’ve been knocking at it!”', 2739)
('“Shouldn’t do that—shouldn’t do that—” the Frog muttered. “Vexes it,', 2740)

('his tree, “and it’ll let _you_ alone, you know.”', 2743)
('At this moment the door was flung open, and a shrill voice was heard', 2744)
('singing:', 2745)

('Alice glanced nervously along the table, as she walked up the large', 2771)

('for some one to speak.', 2779)

('a joint before.', 2783)
('“You look a little shy; let me introduce you to that leg of mutton,”', 2784)
('said the Red Queen. “Alice—Mutton; Mutton—Alice.” The leg of mutton got', 2785)

('bow, not knowing whether to be frightened or amused.', 2787)

('looking from one Queen to the other.', 2789)
('“Certainly not,” the Red Queen said, very decidedly: “it isn’t', 2790)

('And the waiters carried it off, and brought a large plum-pudding in its', 2792)

('However, she didn’t see why the Red Queen should be the only one to', 2799)
('give orders, so, as an experiment, she called out “Waiter! Bring back', 2800)

('_little_ shy with it, as she had been with the mutton; however, she', 2803)

('“What impertinence!” said the Pudding. “I wonder how you’d like it, if', 2806)
('I were to cut a slice out of _you_, you creature!”', 2807)
